  <h3>Welcome to Reddit Playlist Generator</h3>

  <p>There are tons of genre specific music subreddits out there where users post links to their favorite songs. This app attempts to parse those posts and create playlists on spotify for you. At the moment the functionality is pretty basic. It attempts to parse posts based on the common format of <i>artist - song</i> and finding the most popular match on Spotify. Future plans include more advanced parsing logic, fuzzy search, links to purchase the artist's music (i.e. bandcamp) and connectivity with other streaming services. </p>

  <h4>How to use this app</h4>

  <b>Step 1</b>: Login to spotify by clicking the button on the top right.

  <br>
  <b>Step 2</b>: Select a genre from the dropdown (defaulted to Rock/Metal). If you have previously selected a genre and fetched songs from reddit and spotify this will reset your results.
  <br>
  <b>Step 3</b>: Select a subreddit from the dropdown. It will fetch the posts from the subreddit and display them in the Reddit Details tab below. It will also search spotify for the songs. You can see information about the found songs in the Spotify Details tab.
  <br>
  <b>Step 4 (optional)</b>: Select a reddit list category (defaulted to hot) and size of reddit list (defaulted to 20). Note that many subreddits don't return much for categories other than hot, new and top.
  <br>
  <b>Step 5</b>: Click the create playlist button. it will automatically create a public playlist in your spotify account for you.
